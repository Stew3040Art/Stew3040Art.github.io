(Wooo) 3, 2, 1. GO  

🎵  
Have you heard the news, everyone's talking   
Life is good 'cause everything's awesome   
Lost my job, it's a new opportunity   
More free time for my awesome community  

🎵  
I feel more awesome than an awesome opossum   
Dip my body in chocolate frostin'   
Three years later, washed out the frostin'   
Smellin' like a blossom, Everything is awesome   
Stepped in mud, got new brown shoes   
It's awesome to win, and it's awesome to lose (it's awesome to lose)  

🎵  
Everything is better when we stick with Tom Cruise  
Side by side, Tom and I, gonna win forever, let's party forever

Blue skies, bouncy springs   
We just named you awesome things   
A nobel prize, a piece of string   
You know what's awesome, EVERYTHING  

🎵  
Dogs and fleas, allergies, a book of Greek antiquities   
Brand new pants, a very old vest   
Awesome items are the best  

🎵  
Trees, frogs, clogs   
They're awesome   
Rocks, clocks, and socks   
They're awesome   
Figs, and jigs, and twigs   
That's awesome   
Everything you see, or think, or say   
Is awesome
